# Titanic Survivor Prediction (Top 7%)

## Introduction
<p align = "justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project I created prediction model for predict bitcoin price with Gated Recurrent Unit Model. GRU is a gating mechanism in recurrent neural networks (RNN) similar to a long short-term memory (LSTM), GRU have more simple computation and faster than LSTM because have fewer number of gates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dataset used in this model prediction is bitcoin price from 2014 to 2020 were recorded every day. I obtained dataset from kaggle, you can check dataset in this link : https://www.kaggle.com/khalilbrick/bitcoin-data-from-2014-to-2020. Prediction results from the prediction model will evaluate with RMSE and MAPE, to find out how optimal that the prediction models.
